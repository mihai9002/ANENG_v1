# ANENG_v1
An air powered piston engine that can be used for many things, but I won't actually use it for anything

This thig wasn't particularly difficult to make, but i have a feeling that something will go terribly wrong when i'll test it, especially because i made it so small that even the smallest o rings that i have might not fit in. For now, it is only 3d-printable, but i will probably substitute the cylindrical shapes like the crankshaft and piston rod with screws, and fit a bearing for the crankshaft, things that should improve efficiency and reliability.

A few pictures of the engine:

There are a few things to add:
- You can find a 5mm hose at almost all hardware stores
- The engine in this version might very well not work, i'm just submitting this design and beginning all the testing after(if this is against blueprint rules I'm very sorry for losing your time)
- Assembly should be pretty simple, except for the small o ring, since you might need some tweezers to be able to put that in it's little nook

Now, to talk about the air reservoir: Because i don't think everybody has an air compressor at home, I'll usr a soda bottle as an air tank, and that should be more challenging, which is going to make me try to optimise this engine as much as possible, as I want this to run for as much time as it can. I am going to put some youtube tutorials that i find pretty helpful:

Or, you can just use something like this, which i think uses 3d printed 1-way ball valves

I will design some in the future(again, if this is against any rules i'm sorry)

After the "how?", let's get into the "why?":

I started this project because in the past few years, cars have been a big part of my life. Not driving them, but watching, learning how engines work and such. Because i am not skkilled enough to make a 2 stroke engine from scratch, I resorted to making this: a little compressed air engine. I know this is no car engine, but it's a comfortable start, and i hope i will learn a lot of things.
